# University-Expret-System-
    ●This project introduce an expert university system 
    and the different relations between its parts represented as facts and rules in clips and hierarchy ontology in protégé.
    It also discusses how to infer on it using rule based system “clips” and SparQl query language.

# University-Expret-System has the Following Classes:
- University
- Faculty
- Department
- Program (Module)
- Course
- academic staff
- Exams
- Course work
- Thesis
- Lecture hall
- Library
- Lab room
- Lecturer
- TA
- Student

# Part1 (ontology):

    ⦁	Define the different classes and subclasses in the system using ontology.
    ⦁	Define the relations between classes using object property. 
    ⦁	Define the attributes of each class using data property.
    ⦁	Define the individuals (instance) of each class.
    ⦁	Reason on the whole ontology system to infers new data.
    ⦁	Use SparQl query language to extract new knowledge.
